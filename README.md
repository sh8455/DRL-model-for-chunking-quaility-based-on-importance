## Abstract
- The recent rapid growth of over-the-top (OTT) media services and the rise of Internet graphics has increased the demand for online video streaming and made efficient use of network resources critical.
- Since a significant portion of this traffic comes from mobile devices, it is important to consider an individual's mobile data usage and the importance of each chunk of video to provide an optimal streaming experience.
- In this paper, we propose a reinforcement learning-based adaptive streaming approach that considers both an individual's mobile data usage and the importance of each chunk of video. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the algorithm that does not consider the importance of each chunk.
